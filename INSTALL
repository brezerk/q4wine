Known Issues:
***********************************************
1. Non-standard directories

If you have installed q4wine in a non-standard directory, 
and you get the following error message: "error while loading shared libraries: libq4wine-core.so",
then you need to override LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH={$path_to_q4wine_prefix}/lib/ q4wine


2. q4wine prevents user from running winecfg from KRunner even after uninstalling:

You may wish to remove Desktop menu structure as well:
$HOME/.local/share/applications/q4wine

Don't forget to refresh Application cache by runing kbuildsycoca or kbuildsycoca5 (for KDE)
