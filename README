If you plan to use kdesu\gksu\xdg-su, then you might add folowing lines
to /etc/sudoers (use visudo)

#---------- Cut here -------------------------
Cmnd_Alias Q4WINE_COMMS=/sbin/losetup
User_Alias Q4WINE_USERS=%games,%users

Q4WINE_USERS ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: Q4WINE_COMMS
#---------- End of Cut -----------------------

This will allow to run /sbin/losetup, which is used for building mounted iso's menu list,
with out prompting root password.

Otherwise you can't get mount menu working =)
