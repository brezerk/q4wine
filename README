q4wine was originally written by Oleksii S. Malakhov

The general idea for it came from the WineTools script which was originally
written by Frank Hendriksen. It is licensed under the terms of GPLv3.

Send comments, bug reports, etc. to me ;)

Note: This program comes with absolutely no warranty. You will NOT get any
support or help for WineTools, Wine, software installations, Linux or
Microsoft Windows from the author.

If you need help, ask the mailing lists at https://forum.winehq.org/ .

If you want support, buy the commercial versions of wine:
CodeWeavers CrossOver Office https://www.codeweavers.com/ for Desktop
Applications.

Post-install:
***********************************************

-NOTE-
These instructions may be outdated, so please see the latest version of this
howto here:

------

If you plan to use kdesu, gksu or xdg-su, then you may wish to add the
following lines to /etc/sudoers (using visudo)

#---------- Cut here -------------------------
Cmnd_Alias Q4WINE_COMMS=/sbin/losetup
User_Alias Q4WINE_USERS=%games,%users

Q4WINE_USERS ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: Q4WINE_COMMS
#---------- End of Cut -----------------------

This will allow one to run /sbin/losetup, which is used for building the mounted
.isos menues' lists, with out prompting for root password.

Otherwise you will not be able to get the mount menu working. =)

Uninstall:
***********************************************
In the q4wine's build root run:
xargs rm < install_manifest.txt

You may wish to remove Desktop menu structure as well:
$HOME/.local/share/applications/q4wine

Don't forget to refresh Application cache by running kbuildsycoca or kbuildsycoca5 (for KDE)
